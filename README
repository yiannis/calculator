This is just an experiment, to write a simple parser for arithmetic expressions.
The Lexer just reads the full input into a list of Tokens.
Then the Parser creates an AST, using some non-recursive parse functions.

Compile:
$ cmake .
$ make

If you have qt-devel libraries, tests will also be created:
$ ./test

Usage:
$ ./calculator "math-expression" x y t

The parser recognizes x,y,t variables and a few C math functions, eg:
$ ./calculator "x+y+sin(t)" 4 5 2

WARNING:
This code is for testing purposes, not for production use!
